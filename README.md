# MCVersion-Control
MCVersion-Control is a program used to switch between different versions of Minecraft more easily. 

## Development
Still in development phase, most basic features are implemented. Hope to roll out v1.0b in a week or so, once the update manager is complete.

## License
Minecraft Version Control is under an Open Source license.

## Versions
v0.1.1b - Fixes minor bugs
v0.1b 	- First beta release
v0.2a 	- Porting source to new design pattern
v0.1a 	- Initial source

## Future Development
I hope to eventually convert this to a mod manager, that's far down the road though.

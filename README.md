# MCVersion-Control
MCVersion-Control is a program used to switch between different versions of Minecraft more easily. 

## Development
Still in development phase, most basic features are implemented. Hope to roll out v1.0b in a week or so, once the update manager is complete.

## Versions
v0.2a - Porting source to new design pattern
v0.1a - Initial source

## Future Development
I hope to eventually convert this to a mod manager, that's far down the road though.
